DRAW-VELING is a work in progress project, a hybrid platform between a standard blog and a website where people can spend time. The backbone of it is the Art of Drawing combined with the Joy of Traveling.

BLOG: here you can find my regular posts where I try to mix my drawing skills with my ability to tell a story adding something from one of my trip.

ART (coming soon) Art is the ultimate self expression of the individual, in any way or form that suits the person. No one has the right to define what is and what is not art.

This is also an open invitation to “all”. Anyone, regardless of their talent or field can be featured, just get in touch.

FRANCESCO, 32 years of age, graduated in Hospitality & Management. His creative side resurfaced after 10 years of forgetting about it.
